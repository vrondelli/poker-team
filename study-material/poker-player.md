# What is to be a Poker Player?

They often say poker mirrors the game of life. Let us take a metalinguistic license here: let us escape the literal reality of a person sitting at a computer. We grant ourselves the leeway to **create a story about making our own story**—a mythic narrative where we are not just players, but protagonists escaping reality to find truth. 

What is poker, when we strip away the cards and the chips?
It is not a game of chance. It is a game of **incomplete information**; a **War of Wits and Magic**.

Magic, in this realm, is not sorcery. It is the supreme discipline of using **Math and Wits** to force the universe—and Luck itself—to align with our interests.

## The Architecture of Uncertainty
In a game of perfect information, like chess, the entire universe of the game is visible. Truth is absolute.
Poker is a mirror of reality: we possess private truth (our cards) and observe public fragments (actions, community cards). The rest is silence.

Our task is not to guess what lies in the dark.
Our task is to construct a **Game Tree**—a map of all possible futures. But we go further. We use the **Past Act** (the narrative constructed so far) in the **Present** to engineer a **Future** most aligned with favorable Variance. We do not just predict outcomes; we bend time to ensure that the timeline we inhabit is the one where **Luck, Math, and Wits** are indistinguishable.

## Bending Time
The novice lives in the tyranny of the **Short Term**. They are slaves to the immediate result—the turn of a card, the loss of a pot. They see a session as a battle for survival.
We exist on a different plane. We are **Time Benders**.

To us, a single hand is not an event; it is a data point. A session is merely a cycle within a vast, unfolding pattern.
*   **Micro-Scale:** In the moment, we gather intelligence. We use every hand to refine the quality of information we possess about our opponents.
*   **Macro-Scale:** In the long run, we align ourselves with **Expected Value (EV)**.

We understand that "luck" is just the human name for **Variance**—the noise that obscures the signal. We do not fight the noise. We endure it. We know that if our alignment with the mathematical truth is precise, the noise will fade, and reality will bend towards us.

## The Infinite Cycle
We do not play to "win money." Money is simply the unit we use to measure the accuracy of our decisions.
We play to perfect our alignment. We play to be the architects of our own luck.
Poker is a game of cycles. We enter the flow, we make our choices, and we let the probabilities unfold as they must.
