# Poker Team - Recruitment & Selection Process

## 1. Player Acquisition Strategy
Our talent acquisition strategy is based on active selection for cognitive ability and analytical profile, inspired by poker logic.

We developed a **Logic Puzzle** with mechanics similar to poker decision-making (logic, incomplete information, probabilistic thinking). This puzzle acts as a first natural filter.

### Acquisition Roadmap
Physical posters will be distributed at:
*   **UNICAMP** – Exact Sciences area (Analytical profile).
*   **Barão Geraldo** (Student hubs).

**The Poster contains:**
*   A hook related to logic/challenge/poker.
*   QR Code to the Puzzle site.

**The Candidate Journey:**
*   Access site -> Solve Puzzle -> Demonstrate Engagement -> Advance to next steps.

## 2. The Selection Pipeline

1.  **The Digital Assessment (The Puzzle):**
    *   Candidates must pass "3 Nights at the Vault" to prove cognitive flexibility.
    *   *Note:* This comes *before* resumes to filter for raw intelligence.

2.  **Competitive History:**
    *   **Requirement:** "Upper Intermediate" rank in any competitive game (LoL Diamond+, Chess 1500+).
    *   **Poker Option:** Poker graph accepted even if slightly losing (-5 bb/100) if volume is consistent.

3.  **"Study & Prove" Phase:**
    *   **Context:** Zero to Hero. We provide materials.
    *   **The Task:** Study materials and choose ONE assessment:
        *   **Option A (The Grinder):** >80% Score in GTO Wizard Trainer.
        *   **Option B (The Thinker):** 45-min Live Technical Review.

4.  **Trial Period (The "Grind"):**
    *   1 Month Probation.
    *   Goal: Consistency, Communication, Study.

## 3. The Digital Assessment: "3 Nights at the Vault"
Candidates face a **Timed Session**.

**Game Flow:**
1.  **The Manual:** Read Guardian mechanics.
2.  **The Action:** Solve 3 scenarios (Funnel).
3.  **Constraints:** 60s Time Bank, No Pauses.

### Phase 1: The Manual (Loot & Mechanics)
*   **Loot:** Diamond (Max Value), Platinum (High), Gold (High), Silver (Medium), Rock (Worthless).
*   **Aggression:** Guardian Locks/Attacks *only* with High Value (Diamond/Platinum/Gold) or Fake (Rock).
*   **Patterns:** High Value *always* act. **Platinum is Lazy:** Always Locks, Never Attacks. Rock fakes *sometimes*.
*   **Weather:** Stays OUT in rain *only* with Waterproof (Diamond/Gold).
*   **Sound:** "Click" *only* with Metallic (Gold/Silver/Platina).

### Phase 2: The Action (The 3 Nights)

#### Night 1: The Binary Filter
*   **Action:** Guardian **LOCKS**.
*   **Logic:** "Manual says 'Never Aggro with Medium'. Silver is Medium. Out."
*   **Required:** [Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Rock]

#### Night 2: The Frequency Shift
*   **Action:** Guardian **ATTACKS**.
*   **Info:** "Fakes with Rocks **50%** of time."
*   **Logic:**
    *   Diamond/Gold Attack (100%).
    *   Platinum (Lazy) Never Attacks -> **Eliminated**.
    *   Rock Attacks (50%).
*   **Probability Question:** "Exact chance of GOLD?"
*   **Calc:** Gold(1) / [Gold(1) + Diamond(1) + Rock(0.5)] = 1/2.5 = **40%**.
*   **Required:** [Diamond, Gold, Rock] + **40%**.

#### Night 3: Intersecting Lines
*   **Scenario:** **RAIN** + **CLICK**.
*   **Logic:**
    *   Rain = Waterproof (Diamond/Gold).
    *   Click = Metallic (Gold/Silver/Platinum).
    *   Intersection = **GOLD**.
*   **Required:** [Gold] (Perfect Score).

### 3.1 Tactical Log
*   Required justification text field in results to explain the Bayesian Math.
