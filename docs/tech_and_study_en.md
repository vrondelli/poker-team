# Technology & Study Methodology (Data-Driven Edge)

To ensure continuous competitive advantage and dynamic adaptation to the field, the team will adopt a data-driven approach and structured studies, utilizing advanced analysis and simulation tools.

## 1. Massive Data Collection (24/7)
A dedicated Virtual Machine (VM) will be implemented, operating 24 hours a day, with the following objectives:
*   **Automated Capture:** Capture hands played by the field using Hand2Note (H2N).
*   **Database:** Continuous storage of data to build a robust statistical database.
*   **Tendency Monitoring:** Monitoring of population tendencies by stake, position, and action.

**Benefits:**
*   Identification of recurring field leaks.
*   Exploitative adjustments based on real data.
*   Reduction of exclusive dependence on pure GTO in highly exploitable environments.

## 2. Statistical Analysis with Hand2Note (H2N)
H2N will be used for:
*   Analysis of population HUD stats.
*   Creation of specific filters (e.g., overfold in 3-bet pots, underbluff on rivers).
*   Comparison between team performance vs. field.
*   Construction of weekly and monthly tendency reports.

**Expected Outputs:**
*   Exploitative ranges adjusted by stake.
*   Ideal bluff/value frequencies against the field.
*   Prioritization of higher EV spots.

## 3. Advanced Studies with Pio Solver
Pio Solver will be used as a theoretical reference tool (baseline GTO), allowing:
*   Simulation of critical spots identified via H2N.
*   Comparison between field decisions, team decisions, and GTO solutions.
*   Creation of strategic simplifications applicable to real gameplay.

**Study Flow:**
1.  **Identification:** Identify critical spots via H2N data.
2.  **Modeling:** Model the spot in Pio Solver.
3.  **Extraction:** Extract practical heuristics.
4.  **Application:** Apply to ranges and exploitative lines.

## 4. Team Study Structure
*   **Weekly Studies:** Analysis of recurring spots + review of population data.
*   **Individual Studies:** Focus on personal leaks detected via H2N.
*   **Knowledge Base:** Centralized storage of Adjusted Ranges, Study Scripts, Pio Solution Screenshots, and Strategic Notes.

## 5. Strategic Objective of the Study System
The final objective is not just to play "correctly", but rather:
*   To **exploit** the field systematically and measurably.
*   To create a continuous cycle of **Collection → Analysis → Adjustment → Execution**.
*   To keep the team always ahead of field adaptation, even in high-rake environments.
