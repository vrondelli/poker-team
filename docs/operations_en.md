# Operational Guidelines

## 1. Daily Routine
*   **Volume Check:** ~430 hands/day/player daily average (or ~1k/session 3x a week).
*   **Stop-loss Enforcement:** Hard stop at -4 BI ($80) loss in a single day to prevent tilt.
*   **Reporting:** Post results in Discord immediately after session.

## 2. Weekly Review
*   Check actual **Rake Paid vs Estimated** (Target: 9 bb/100).
*   Verify **Rakeback payouts** on the platform.
*   **Team Study Session** (See `tech_and_study_en.md`).

## 3. Monthly Goals
*   **Volume:** Hit 36k hands combined (Team).
*   **Review:** Net Winrates check. Adjust Bankroll strategy if edges decrease.
